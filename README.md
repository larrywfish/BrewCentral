Brew Central
======================

#Description:

BrewCentral is an app for homebrewers to create and manage recipes along with ingredient inventories.  It also has tools to assist on brew day such as timers as well as various useful calculators.

The one thing that sets BrewCentral apart from other brewing applications is that it contains a search tool for commercial beers.  If the commercial beer contains ingredient information, it can be imported into a new recipe in your own database.

But most of this is yet to come.  The only thing this app currently does is a very simple commercial beer search and calculator for strike water temperature.
